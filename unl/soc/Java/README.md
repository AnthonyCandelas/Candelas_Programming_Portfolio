Java starter notes

- Keep source files with package unl.soc; update MAIN to the class with main().
- Copy Makefile.template into the assignment folder and rename it to makefile.
- make compile builds into bin/; make run MAIN=YourClass runs unl.soc.YourClass.
- If using cmd.exe, replace mkdir/rm commands with Windows equivalents.
